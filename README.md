### 💡 Usage Examples

- 🔍 **"Find a skill that can fill PDF forms"** — Searches all 4 sources simultaneously, returns ranked results with descriptions, links, and popularity metrics
- 🛡️ **"Audit this skill before I install it"** — Downloads to a sandboxed staging area, runs 12-rule static security scan, reports risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/EXTREME)
- 📊 **"What's trending this week?"** — Generates a weekly report of top 8 curated skills using a three-signal selection model (heat 50% + relevance 30% + freshness 20%)
- 📦 **"Search ClawHub for MCP tools"** — Source-specific search with parallel `clawhub inspect` calls for download counts and summaries
- 🐉 **"Find skills on SkillHub (CN)"** — Queries the Tencent SkillHub public API for China-accelerated, compliant skill discovery
- ⏰ **"Set up weekly auto-report"** — Scheduled recurring report with curated top 8 picks, delivered to your preferred messaging platform at your chosen frequency
- 🧹 **"Find newly created agent skills on GitHub"** — Tracks repos created in the past week, surfaces fresh projects before they go mainstream
- ✅ **"Install this skill safely"** — Staging area isolation + scanner.py audit + risk-gated install command output

### ✨ Core Highlights

#### 🌐 Four-Source Discovery

| Source | API Type | Auth Required | Strength |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|
| GitHub | HTTP API | GITHUB_TOKEN (optional, 60→5000 req/h) | Largest repo pool, stars/language/update metadata |
| ClawHub | CLI (npx) | None | Curated skill registry, inspect for downloads/summary |
| SkillHub | HTTP API + CLI | None (public) | China-accelerated, Tencent-backed, CN-friendly |
| Skills.sh | CLI (npx) | None | Install-count visibility, emerging ecosystem |

The search engine queries all 4 sources in parallel based on your keywords, deduplicates results, and presents them in a unified ranked format with source labels (🐙GitHub / 🦀ClawHub / 🐉SkillHub / 🛠️Skills.sh).

#### 🛡️ 12-Rule Security Scanner

Every external skill is scanned before installation using `scanner.py` with:

- **10 Hard Reject rules** (R1-R10): External URL requests, base64 execution, eval/exec, credential path access, Agent file access, code obfuscation, bare IP requests, privilege escalation, credential exfiltration, undeclared package installs
- **2 AI-specific rules** (AI1-AI2): Prompt injection detection, cryptocurrency mining signatures
- **4 Yellow Flag rules** (Y1-Y4): Agent directory writes, network requests, env var modifications, background processes

Scanner outputs **summaries only** (rule_id, file, line number) — never raw code — to prevent prompt injection through scanned content.

#### 📊 Three-Signal Curation Model

```
Curation basis = Heat (50%) + Relevance (30%) + Freshness (20%)
```

- **Heat**: Log-normalized stars/downloads across all results
- **Relevance**: Keyword density matching (agent-skill, mcp, automation, etc.)
- **Freshness**: Created this week = 20, this month = 10, older = 2

Forced mixing in weekly reports: ≥4 GitHub + ≥2 ClawHub + ≥1 SkillHub + ≥1 Skills.sh (when available).

#### 📨 Scheduled Trend Reports

- Top 8 curated picks + backup section
- Source-forced diversity (no single-source dominance)
- Deduplication: ClawHub by slug, GitHub same-owner ≤2
- Auto-delivered to your preferred messaging platform
- User scene profiling for personalized recommendations
- Schedule frequency is fully customizable — weekly, bi-weekly, or any interval that fits your workflow.

### 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Local execution only** — all scripts run on your machine, no data sent to any server
- **No telemetry** — zero tracking, zero analytics, zero phone-home
- **Sandboxed staging** — external skills are downloaded to `/tmp/skill-hunter-staging/`, never directly to your skills directory
- **Scanner isolation** — `scanner.py` outputs summaries only, never raw code, to prevent prompt injection through scanned content
- **Risk-gated installation** — 4-level risk assessment (🟢 LOW / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🔴 HIGH / ⛔ EXTREME) with mandatory human approval for HIGH/EXTREME
- **Token safety** — GITHUB_TOKEN is read from environment only, never written to any file
